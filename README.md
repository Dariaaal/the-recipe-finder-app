# the-recipe-finder-app

## Overview:

Recipe Finder is an application for searching and viewing recipes. Users can find recipes by query, cuisine and preparation time.

There are three pages: 
1. HomePage, where you can write your query.
2. RecipesPage, where you can see recipes list depending on your query.
3. RecipeDetailsPage, where you can see the details about chosen recipe.

I created separate components: SuspenseWrapper, MenuOptions, Recipe, RecipesList. You can find them in src/components folder.

Functions for fetching information are in the folder src/lib.

## How to Run:

1. Install dependencies: yarn install
2. Start the development server: yarn dev
